# Tasks

Tasks is a simple PyQT application that helps you manage your tasks efficiently.

You can add tasks, and move them between To-Do, In-Progress, and Completed categories. You can also record the actual and estimated time to complete each task, and take a break using the built-in counter.

Tasks saves your list locally for persistence, so you don't have to worry about losing your data.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Move tasks between To-Do, In-Progress, and Completed categories
- Record actual and estimated time to complete each task
- Take a break using the built-in counter
- Save and load tasks locally

## Usage
The main window of Tasks shows you three sections: To-Do, In-Progress, and Completed. You can add a new task by clicking on the "Add" button in each section header. A dialog will pop up where you can enter the task name and estimated time to complete. You can also edit, or delete an existing task by right-clicking on it and selecting the appropriate option.

To move a task, right-click on it and select the section you want to move it to. If you move it to the Completed section, a dialog will pop up asking for the actual time it took to complete the task.

If you need a 10-minute break, you can use the built-in timer at the bottom of the main window. An alarm will sound when your break is over.

At the end of your day, you can move all remaining "In-Progress" tasks back to the "To-Do" section by using the "Clear All" button.
